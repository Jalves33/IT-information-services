#The linux Directory Structure
#Summary of the most common Directories
# / ("Root") the top of the file system Hierarchy
# /bin Binaries( machine code) and other executable programs
# /etc system configuration files (controls system config files or how other programs work)
# /home Home of directories
# /opt Optional or third party software such as google chome or google earth
# /tmp temporary space, typically cleared on reboot ( not a good idea to put imporant files here)
# /usr user related programs
# /var variable data, for example log files

#Third party software such as google is usually either installed in /opt or user/local
#/opt/google
#/usr/local/google

#Sometimes third party programs could install in the opt directory with their bin and lib directories
#but could install the config files in etc/opt/google and the log files in /var/opt/google
