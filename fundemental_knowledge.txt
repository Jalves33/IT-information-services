#####What is the Shell

It is the command line interface, a program that takes the command you type and executes them
It is also refered to as the command line interpreter
It can be more powerful than the GUI, tasks can be done alot faster
Most server distros do not include GUI, Desktop have both



###The Prompt
$ prompt signifies a normal user were a # signifies a superuser like root which can do anything

~ represents home So ~ would be /home/jalves




###Basic commands

ls - lists directory contents

cd - change directory
. represents this directory .. represents the above directory

pwd -  present working dir
cat - Concatenates and displays files
echo - Displays arguments to the screen

man - Displays the online manual to commands
Press Enter to move down one lines Space to move down one page
Press g to move to the top of the page G to the bottom and q to quit
man -k SEARCH_TERM to search for man pages

Use --help or -help to get help with a command for example cal --help


exit - exits the shell or your current session
clear - Clears the screen

Which - locate a command
if there are multiple paths to a command then the first one reached will be executed




###Environmental Variables

storage location that has a name and a value. it is typically in uppercase
Acess the conents by executing: echo $VAR_NAME

#$PATH

contains an environment variable
controls the command search path
contains a list of dir


$OLDPWD - holds the directory that you previous were in

###Executing Commands
$PATH determines command search path
you can specify a command with a full path
you can execute command not in $PATH by 
./command = execute command in this dir


###Creating and removing Directories
mkdir - creates a directory
mkdir -p - creates a directory within a directory e.g mkdir -p test/sales/dept
rmdir - Removes a directory
rm -rf directory - Recurseively (the directory and all the dir and files in it) removes the directory
Remember once deleted its gone forever!

###Understanding the ls command

Permissions      Number of links  Owner  Group  byte size   Last Modification time       filename
drwxr-xr-x.             2         jalves jalves    6              Aug 30 16:18            Desktop


hidden files start with a period and are not displayed by default
ls -a shows hidden files and can be combined with other options like -l(long list)
ls -la will display the conents of the directory in long formation along with hidden files
can be written ls -a -l     or   ls -lar      both do the same
-F option reveals fire types /Directory @Link *Executable
-t option list files by time
-r option list files in reverse order
-lart option will list all the files by time in reverse order
-R option lists files recursively
-d option lists only the directories
--color will coloize the output


###Symbolic Links
a link points to the actual file or dir
you use the link as it were the file
a link can be used to create a shortcut and is usualled used for long files and dir
it is also used to signal that the file or dir is the current version of sotware


###The tree Command

is like the ls command but creates a visual output

tree -d list directories only
tree -C coloizes the ouput

###Tips and Tricks

Do NOTE uses Sspaces in file names or dirctories

Use - or _ capitalizethe first letter of each word e.g ThisIsMyFileNameRightHereSee

When working with spaces in dir or file names you can use quotes on both ends to escape
For example "this is my file with sapces i should not have made.txt"

You can also use the backslash symbol to escape spaces
for example this\ is\ my\ file\ name
