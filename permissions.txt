###Symbols

g = groups
o = other
a = all


###Groups

Every user belongs to at least one group but can belong to many
groups - displays a users groups
id -Gn    Does the same
groups (username) - displays that users	groups


###Changing Permissions
chmod - change mode command
u g o a    are categories (u, user g, group o, other a, all)
=-+ equals, subtract, add is used to set permissions
rwx is again Read Write Execute

chmod using equals gives exactly what you put and putting nothing after = means no permissions.
for example    chmod u=rwx, o= myfile.txt      will give the user read write and execute permissions.
and give others no permissions

you can use chmod with numeric characters
each number is represents the total value of the persions
7= r(4)+w(2)+x(1)
6= r+w
5=r+x 
4=r
3=w+x
2=w
1=r

744 = -rwxr--r--
700 = -rwx------

chmod 744 myfile.txt    will change the file perssions to -rwxr--r-- which is read write execute
permissions for the user, read permissions for the group, and read permissions for other.

### The umask Command
umask (-S) (mode)
